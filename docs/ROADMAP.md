# roadkeep — Roadmap (active backlog)

> **Single source of truth for task status.** Flat, one line per task.
> Only **unshipped** work lives here (📋 designed · 💭 idea · ⏳ partial · 🛠 in-progress).
> Shipped work moves to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); design rationale lives in
> [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md).
>
> **What this is.** A CLI that owns writes to a project's roadmap, changelog,
> improvements and strategy files, so the format is a schema at the point of
> insertion instead of a convention an author is asked to remember — shipped as a
> Claude Code plugin, because the author to constrain is usually an agent.
>
> **The one law.** *A field limit enforced only by a reviewer is a limit discovered
> after the prose is written.* `add` refuses an over-length field; `lint` refuses a
> file that drifted anyway. The tool validates — it never writes prose.
>
> **An entry here is one sentence: what + why + `→` pointer** — ≤320 characters,
> symptom in bold (what does not work), never a solution name. This file is the
> tool's own conformance fixture: if `lint` cannot pass it, `lint` is wrong.
>
> **How to pick work:** the lowest-numbered task whose `deps` are all shipped.

## Priority

## Block A — The model (a task is data before it is a line)

## Block B — Authoring (insert, never hand-edit)

- 📋 **RK1453** (deps: —) **A decision's sentence has no correction door, so a typo outlives the decision** — record amend reaches the ledger and supersede is for a replaced decision; what ship --decides filed has neither. → §RK1453
- 📋 **RK1454** (deps: —) **block drop refuses a finished block without naming the ending that is correct** — The refusal reads as a failure to a caller told to run it at the block boundary, and nothing says the block is already ended. → §RK1454

## Block C — Query (consult without reading the file)

- 📋 **RK1455** (deps: —) **a changelog listing cannot be asked for its blocks, so the only way to see them is to read the file** — An unscoped ledger listing is 117k characters and a scoped one needs a block label the caller does not have, so finding what the blocks are means reading the governed file. → §RK1455
- 📋 **RK1456** (deps: —) **budget says what a why is allowed and nothing measures the why about to be written** — A section can be measured before it is sent and a line's fields cannot, so a caller either hand-counts code units or spends a refusal per attempt. → §RK1456

## Block D — The gate

- 📋 **RK1457** (deps: —) **non-goal.reaches fires on every lint and nothing clears it, so a project that decided reads the same note forever** — Its own remedy is non-goal amend; a project named both bounded lines inside the rule's paragraph and both are still flagged, so the gate carries unanswerable notes. → §RK1457

## Block E — Adoption

## Block F — The Claude Code plugin (the guardrail at the agent boundary)

- 📋 **RK1451** (deps: —) **engines lists only the copy it is, so a vendored engine the launcher runs has no row and both copies exit clean** — The hook and the MCP server run .roadkeep/ at 0.1.1269 while a shell reaches 0.2.58, and each answers writing with itself and names no disagreement. → §RK1451
- 📋 **RK1452** (deps: —) **the server reports the version it loaded while that same path holds another, and calls the result agreed** — install --vendor replaced .roadkeep under a running MCP server, which kept 0.1.1269 in memory for a directory now holding 0.2.4 and still answered agreed. → §RK1452

## Block G — The editor surface (the backlog where the file is open)

## Block H — The tool's own shape (what one verb costs to change)

## Block I — The documentation area (what an adopter reads before there is a session to ask)

## Done when — Block D

- **The gate passes on this repository's own docs** the format is proven by the artefact
  and not asserted in a README, so a limit these lines cannot express is the wrong limit
  rather than a set of wrong lines.
- **Every finding names the command that closes it** a report a reader cannot act on is
  one they skip, so each carries a complete argv and `--fix` runs the derived half of
  them (RK420, RK16).

## Done when — Block F

- **One install wires every surface a session reads** five of them — hook, skill,
  commands, manifest, server — and a launcher where no plugin can be, so an adopter runs
  one command and none of them drifts.
- **The guard denies a hand edit and names the verb** a refusal that stops at no is a
  detour; this boundary exists to turn an agent toward the command rather than away from
  the file.

## Done when — Block H

- **One verb's change is read in one module** each module's docstring is the authority
  and `origin <id>` answers where a rule came from, so what a change costs is bounded by
  where the answer lives.
- **Every served tool answers one question** a verb answering eight subjects is refused
  by whichever arrived last, and the seam is the tense: what a write may spend is not
  what a surface does (RK1321).

## Done when — Block A

- **One parser reads a line and one renderer writes it** the format is a schema and not
  a regex over prose, so a line that would render back differently refuses the whole
  file rather than being normalised (L1, L3).
- **An id is spent once, whatever holds it** a number two writes could mint is one two
  designs share in the history, so what derives an id reads every file a project
  declares and prose counts as carrying one.

## Done when — Block B

- **Every write a governed file takes has a verb** a hand edit is the drift this tool
  exists to refuse, so the guard denies one and names the command — and a state
  reachable only by editing the file is a verb that is missing.
- **A write lands whole or leaves the tree untouched** three files change on a ship and
  whichever is done last is the one forgotten, so every field is validated before
  anything is written and a refusal costs a retry and never a deletion.

## Done when — Block C

- **Every question is a command, and its answer is bounded** reading the file to answer
  costs the context this tool exists to save, so a read fits a tool result and says what
  it left out rather than inheriting a guarantee it gave up (L5).
- **One reading, two registers** the printed answer and the payload come off one record,
  because a printer and a payload builder agreeing by hand is how an agent comes to be
  told less than the person at the terminal.

## Done when — Block E

- **A project that already has a backlog can adopt this** a tool that needs an empty
  repository cannot be adopted by the repository that needs it, so drift is measured and
  forgiven by name against a baseline rather than refusing the file.
- **One command wires it, and one read says what is wired** three copies of this tool
  can answer at once and they are allowed to differ, so what is not survivable is being
  unable to say which of them wrote, judged or gated.

## Done when — Block G

- **The backlog is legible where the file is open** a format an author meets only in a
  terminal is one they edit by hand in the editor, so the surface holding the file
  offers the same writes under the same limits.
- **A surface in another language is gated in this tree** CI proving the Python and
  nothing else is a client that breaks on a renamed key with nobody reporting it, so the
  payload is asserted here as an outside client reads it.

## Done when — Block I

- **A reader with no checkout can answer an adopter's question** evaluation comes before
  installation, so an answer that needs an installed copy is one the reader who most
  needs it cannot reach.
- **Every reference page is generated from this package** a page retyping a flag, a code
  or a config key is wrong at the first rename and reports nothing, so the build derives
  them and fails where the two disagree.
- **No page restates prose another file owns** an area with room on every page invites
  the accretion this tool refuses, so a page renders the file that owns the words or
  carries no version of them.

## Non-goals

Deliberately **not** built — check this list before proposing work:

- **No web UI and no server.** Files and a CLI. The store is the repository.
- **No model and no prompts.** The tool validates and renders; it never writes the
  symptom or the rationale. A generator would reintroduce exactly the prose drift
  this exists to stop.
- **No enforced id scheme beyond `<prefix><n>`.** Non-contiguous, retired-never-reused
  is a property of real backlogs, not a defect to normalize.
- **No dates or quarters.** A marker is maturity, not a schedule.
- **No backlog in an issue tracker** (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues.) A backlog that lives
  in a service is one an agent cannot `Grep`; a one-way report about this tool, sent
  explicitly, moves nothing out of the files.
- **No multi-line task line.** A task whose text wraps across paragraphs, with its deps
  on a `↳` line of their own, is a second grammar; reading only the first line would
  ship a truncated why and orphan the rest.
- **No supported Python API.** The CLI, the MCP tools and the plugin are the surface; a
  boundary held by a test inside the package is not one, so nothing ships `py.typed` and
  a rename still breaks nobody.
- **No effort or size field.** Nothing can verify a letter, `pick`'s every tier is a
  fact, and what an agent pays is context — median to p90, files vary 1.4× against lines
  2.7×, so the letter prices the axis nobody pays.
