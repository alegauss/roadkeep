# roadkeep — Design rationale

> Rationale for **unshipped** sections only. Status markers live in
> [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); shipped work is described in
> [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and `git log`. When a section ships, delete it here.

## §0 — Why this exists

### §0.1 The measured problem

Three files in the Viglet Shio repository declare a format and none enforces it:

| Artefact | Rule | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | one sentence per task | 92 active lines, **142 words** average, worst **1406 characters** (7× the best) |
| `agents.md` | index only, resident every turn | grew to **186 KB (~46k tokens)** before it was split |
| `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md` | rationale for *unshipped* work | accreted shipped implementation reports; the sibling project's reached **539 KB** |

The pattern is identical in all three: an author with the whole design in working
memory writes it where the reader will be, and the reader is a file that gets loaded
every turn. Shio measured this in SH341 and found **six of the eight worst lines were
written in the session that then diagnosed the problem** — so this is a drift the
process invites, not a lapse of attention. An instruction to be terse does not survive
the moment its author knows more than the line allows.

### §0.2 Why the fix is a write path, not a linter

A linter reports after the prose exists, and by then the cost is already paid: the
tokens were spent generating it, and the author is being asked to delete work. A field
with `maxLength: 200` refuses at the point of insertion, before a sentence is composed
to fill it. Same rule, two orders of magnitude cheaper — and it converts an analytical
act ("is this line too long, and what would I cut?") into a procedural one ("call
`add`"). **The saving is the analysis, not the characters.**

### §0.3 The six laws

| # | Law |
|---|---|
| L1 | **The format is a schema, enforced where the text is created** — `add` refuses; `lint` is the backstop for what bypassed it. |
| L2 | **The store is the repository** — Markdown, greppable, diffable, no database and no service. |
| L3 | **Round-trip or don't write** — parse → render → byte-identical, or the tool may not own the file. |
| L4 | **The tool never writes prose** — it validates and renders. A generator would reintroduce the drift. |
| L5 | **Query instead of read** — every question a maintainer asks the file is a command, so answering it costs no context. |
| L6 | **Configuration, not convention** — prefix, paths, markers and limits are declared per project. |

L5 is the one that pays for the rest. `pick` replaces loading 558 lines to find one
task; `stats` replaces a grep whose misses are silent; `show` replaces joining two
files by hand. Those three are most of what an agent currently spends a roadmap
session doing.

### §0.4 The limits, measured against a live corpus

§0.1 asked whether the limits are right or the lines are. Shio's 78 active lines answer
it, and the answer is split in a way that only a real backlog could have produced — the
reading RK20 took:

| Field | Limit | p50 | p90 | max | Over |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `symptom` | 120 | 58 | 86 | 111 | **0 of 78** |
| `why` | 200 | 481 | 900 | 1251 | **70 of 78** |

The same authors, in the same lines, met one limit every single time and missed the
other 89% of the time. So 89% is not evidence that 200 is too small — `symptom` is the
control, and it shows compliance is available. The difference is that "what does not
work" is one clause by construction and a `why` has no natural end, which is L1 stated
as a measurement: the field whose scope is unbounded is the one that needs the bound at
the write path.

And the migration is smaller than that task assumed. **74 of the 78 pointers resolve,
and none dangle**; 67 of the 70 over-length lines point at a section that already exists
and makes the same argument — compared line-against-section on SH295 and SH309, the
`why` is a recompression of the paragraph, same examples and all. The rationale is not
homeless. The line is a second copy of it, so the edit is compression against a text
already written, not authorship.

## Block A — The model

### §RK201 The one surface RK185 did not reach

RK185 made the case in one sentence: a model has no characters, so a limit published
only in them is a target reached by trial. It then published the word aim on every
surface an author reads *before* composing — the MCP field schema, `budget`, `brief`,
the skill.

The refusal is the surface they reach after, and it still says "delete 9 characters".
That is exact and it is unactionable in the same way the ceiling was: the author
subtracts a number they cannot measure, and the observed loop is five retries against
one gate in a single session of this repository's own work.

The correction is small and it is not a second opinion: RK184 already computes the
surplus, and stating it as words alongside is the same conversion `budget` makes, from
the same constant. "Delete 9 characters — about two words" is a sentence an author can
act on without re-composing.

Two things to be careful of. The word figure here is a *surplus* and not an aim, so it
rounds the other way: rounding down would name a cut that does not clear the gate. And
the refusal must keep the character number first, because that one is exact and the word
one is an approximation of it — an author told only "two words" and given a 9-character
overrun would be back to guessing, with a smaller number to guess against.

## Block B — Authoring

## Block C — Query

### §RK200 The record with no way to read it

RK175 closed the symptom it was filed for: a governed file whose bytes no verb wrote is
named as the turn ends. What it did not give is a way to *ask*. The digest sidecar is a
temp file whose name is a digest, the comparison happens inside a hook, and the answer
reaches exactly one reader at exactly one moment.

That is the arrangement RK161 ended for claims, and the argument is the same one: L5
says every question is a command, and "which lines are claimed" had to be answered by
finding a temp file. Here it is worse in one way — reporting **re-baselines**,
deliberately, so a turn that ends is a turn whose evidence is consumed. A session asking
afterwards what happened has nothing to read, and neither has the next one.

The obvious shape is the one `claims --prune` has: a read that says which governed files
are attested, which are not, and where the record lives — without moving the baseline,
because a query that changes the answer to the next query is not a query. Whether the
`Stop` block should stop re-baselining once such a read exists is the second question
and not this one.

What to check first is whether anybody wants it. The claim registry earned its read
because `pick` stepped over ids and could not say whose; this record has one consumer
and may not need a second.
