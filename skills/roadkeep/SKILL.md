name: roadkeep
description: "Call the roadkeep CLI instead of editing a project's governed ROADMAP.md, CHANGELOG.md, IMPROVEMENTS.md or STRATEGY.md. Use when adding, shipping, retiring or recording a task, changing a marker, writing a rationale section, picking what to work on next, or reading a backlog, ledger or dependency graph — and whenever an edit to one of those files was denied or `roadkeep lint` reported a violation. Trigger words: roadmap, backlog, changelog, task line, block, ship, retire, next task, roadkeep."

# roadkeep — call the command, never type the format

The line format is a schema at the point of insertion, not a convention to remember. Every
field is validated before a sentence exists, so a refusal costs a retry and never a deletion.
Read `roadkeep.toml` for this project's prefix, id shape, paths, markers and limits (L6);
nothing below hardcodes them. `roadkeep` is the installed entry point — `python -m roadkeep.cli` when it is
not on PATH.

## Writing and shipping

When the `mcp__roadkeep__*` tools are available, **prefer them**: the whole write path and
the reads a task needs are there — `add`, `block_add`, `block_drop`, `claim`, `scope`, `status`, `amend`, `restate`, `ship`, `retire`, `defer`, `resume`,
`record_add`,
`record_amend`, `record_move`, `record_drop`, `record_renumber`, `non_goal_add`, `non_goal_drop`, `section_add`, `section_amend`, `section_drop`, `budget`, `brief`, `pick`, `list`, `deps`, `lint`, `merge_check` — same engine and same
refusals, with
the fields arriving as a schema instead of flag names typed from memory. `init`, `adopt` and
`install` run once per project and want the CLI — the last of them wires this file, the tools
and the guard into a project running the tool from a checkout, and `install --check` is what
holds its copy of this file in step. `uninstall` is the way back out, for a project moving to
the plugin: it takes out this project's entries and nothing else, keeps the CI workflow, and
needs no checkout to read, so it still works once that tree is gone. Every guarantee below holds either way.

`roadkeep <add|status|amend|restate|ship|retire|record|non-goal|section> --help` has the flags. What they guarantee,
so it costs you no thought: the id, the `→ §<id>` pointer, the status default and every
`(deps: … ✅)` annotation are **derived, never typed** — where a project declares `prefix` as a
list it numbers by track, and then `add --prefix <letter>` says which track while the number
stays derived, per family. Where it declares `ref_scheme = "outline"` the anchor is not
derivable at all, so `add --ref <x.y>` is the field that names it — offered over MCP too, and
only there, an `add` without it on such a project being refused `ref.missing`; there the id in
a section's heading is what binds it to its line, and it too is appended for you. Where
`[refs]` gives a prose file a **namespace**, that file's addresses are written
`<prefix>:<x.y>` and it answers no bare one — two files each numbering their own outline
from `I` being one flat set of addresses otherwise, which `anchors` reports as `doubled` and
the gate as `section.ambiguous`. The prefix rides on the pointer alone: the heading keeps the
number the file wrote, and `anchors` names the free address in each namespace. A refusal exits 2 naming the length and
the limit and writes nothing; the shipped marker never reaches the roadmap. **A line renders a
pointer, and the pointer has to resolve**: `add --section "<title>"` writes the rationale in
the same transaction — the prose on stdin or `--section-body`, both files validated before
either is written — and an `add` without it answers with the `section add` that closes the
pointer it just created, rather than leaving the gate to say so. **`ship <id> --why "<what now works>"` makes
its three edits** (ledger entry, roadmap line gone, `§<id>` deleted) plus the dependents'
annotations, or none. It **names any section whose prose cited what it deleted**: the ship is
right and that citation is your next edit, in *this* commit, because a shipped entry keeps no
pointer and from the next command on the reference reads exactly like a typo. **You read that
design and the code may have moved under it**: `--superseded-design "<what it was wrong
about>"` is the trace, parenthesised into the ledger's own sentence with the anchor, because
the deletion otherwise leaves the one reader who could ever know it was stale — you — with
nowhere to say so; refused on a line that pointed at no design and on a `--part`, whose
section stays. And `--why` is **required**, because the roadmap's sentence states a
problem and the ledger's states an outcome, so inheriting it files a defect report under a
heading meaning "done" (`record amend <id> --why` is the repair where one already did), and `retire <id> [--superseded-by <id>] --reason "…"` is the same
transaction, two more doors — **open on every project, including one that declares
`[ledger] marker = false`**: there the retirement is the one line in that file to carry a
marker, a departure being the one status a ledger of shipped work does not state about
itself. `ship` is not the way round it either way: an outcome filed under ✅ is a shipment,
and `Backlog.retired` reads the marker. **The `symptom` is not one of `amend`'s fields** — it is the
falsifiable claim the line is, so a different one is a different task — and where the premise
itself turned out false, `restate <id> --symptom "…"` is that correction and the only door to
it: the id, the deps, the marker and the section all stay, because the work never changed and
only the description of it was wrong. Reach for it instead of `retire` plus `add`, which spends
an id and deletes a design that was already right. It takes no reason: the format has nowhere
to put one, so the commit that removes the false claim is where it belongs. **`ship <id>` is also how one that stopped halfway is finished**:
the ledger is written first, so a crash leaves the id in two files (`lint` says `id.two-files`)
and re-running `ship` closes the line without writing a second entry. It refuses instead where
the files say the work is in halves — a ⏳ line or an entry naming one — or where the line and
the entry describe different work, which is two tasks sharing an id and `renumber`'s to fix. **Half of it landing is a third answer, not a full ship
with a hedge in the sentence**: `ship <id> --part "<which half>"` records the entry as
`✅ **<id> (which half)**` and *leaves the line open* at ⏳ with its section intact, and the
later `ship <id>` completes it — replacing that entry in place and dropping the qualifier,
which is the only thing that keeps "local half" from outliving the local half. That
replacement states a *different* sentence, so on a ledger written before the tool, where the
partial's bullet **wraps**, it takes `--lines <n>` for the same reason `record amend` does and
is refused without it; the count is a flag on this verb rather than a detour through that one
because you asked to finish work, and it is refused on every path that replaces no entry. A **second**
`--part` is refused and says why: one id carries one partial and then the completion, so work
arriving in more halves than that files each delivered step as its own line, and the refusal
spells the id that line takes under this project's `[ids]`. **A pause is none of those three**: `defer <id> --reason "…"` moves
the line to the deferred store, keeping the id, the deps, the symptom and the section a
departure deletes, and `resume <id> [--marker <m>]` is the return direction the ledger has
none of — the reason wraps the `why` on the way out and is unwrapped on the way back, and the
open marker is what the store could not keep, so `--marker` is where you say which it was.
A dep on a paused task resolves as **deferred**, and the line waiting on it as
`blocked-paused` — not offered, counted apart, and unblocked by a `resume` rather than a ship.
Reach for `retire` only when the work is not coming back. `record add --block <x> --symptom "…" --why "…"` is the fourth — never
planned, so the ledger entry alone and the roadmap untouched, and `record drop <id>` is its inverse:
refused unless the ledger states that id **twice** *and the two say the same thing*, then the
later entry goes and the first stays,
because removing the only record of a decision is deleting history. Two entries that differ are
two deliveries under one id, not one recorded twice: `record drop <id> --line <n>` if you have
read both, or `record renumber <id> --line <n>` to give one its own address. To *fix* an entry use
`record amend <id> --why "…"` (or `--part` on a partial) — never drop-and-re-add, which moves
the line to the end of its block and shows a reviewer a deletion where a word changed. On a
ledger written before the tool, where a bullet **wraps**, that correction is refused until
`--lines <n>` says how many lines it replaces: the parse holds only as much of the sentence as
fits on the first one, so rewriting that line alone leaves the tail of the old sentence under
the new one. The
block is not one of its fields, because filing an entry elsewhere **is** a move:
`record move <id> --to-block <x>` is that one, and it says so — the line is re-placed under the
named heading, both positions are reported, and a heading nothing declares is refused. Reach
for it when `ship` filed an entry under the block its roadmap line was wrongly under. `section add <id> --title "…"` is that
same write for a line that already exists, and
takes prose on **stdin**, within the word budget, filled to the configured width, under the
task's block — or, where the pointer is an outline anchor, under the section that anchor extends,
since there the anchor is what states the place. A one-segment anchor **opens a new top level**,
placed after the last one and at the depth that file writes one at, which is how a block declared
in the line files gets its first design at all; a *nested* one is written one level under the
section it extends, so it stays inside the subtree its anchor names whatever depth that file
nests at, and a nested anchor whose parent is missing is still refused, that being a typo in an
address. A table or list is inserted exactly as written. Over MCP there is no pipe, so the
three writes that read one (`add`'s `section_body`, `section_add`'s and `section_amend`'s `body`)
take it **as a string** and refuse the omission rather than waiting for it. **`section amend <id>` is how a
live design is corrected**: `--body -` replaces its own prose, `--title` its heading, the
subtree and the anchor are untouched, and it is the only door — `section drop` is refused
while an open line points at the anchor **or at any address under it**, named in the refusal,
whether this file writes that address as a heading or as a bullet; that is right, and shipping
is not a way to fix a paragraph. No write invents a block
heading — **`block add <x> --title "…"` is the one that declares one**, in every governed file already organised by blocks, placed after the last block's subtree and spelled at that file's own level and separator. Reach for it the moment any write refuses with "no heading declares".
Block order is what `list` reports and what a reader takes for the shape of the plan, so
`--after <label>` opens one **between** two existing blocks: it names a neighbour rather than an
index, each file placing the heading after its own copy of that heading, and a file that wants
the heading and declares no such neighbour is refused rather than appended.
`block drop <x>` withdraws a label opened by mistake: the heading goes only from the files where
its whole subtree is blank, and anything filed under it — an open line, a paused one, a
rationale section — is named in a refusal that writes nothing, because a heading over work is
not an empty heading. The ledger keeps its heading either way, history being filed under it. `non-goal add --lead "…" --why "…"` writes the one bullet that is not a task line,
where `[non_goals]` declares the list governed: addressed by its lead, which is unique and
checked, and carrying no marker, dep or pointer, because a constraint has no status to state.
`non-goal drop <lead>` is the other half, and what a *correction* takes: the lead is the address,
so a constraint whose lead changes is one dropped and one written. **Call `non-goal list` before
an `add`** — the list binds what may be proposed, so reading it after the line exists is reading
it too late; it prints on a project that never opted in, and nothing checks a proposal against it
for you, that being a judgement about meaning and this tool having no model (L4).
Every write prints one `event <id> Block <x> open|empty` line, the whole payload a
hook gets — a non-goal excepted, having neither an id nor a block. There is no second route: `Edit` on a governed file is denied, naming the command,
and `lint` gates the turn's end.

**An id is an address, and a merge can spend one twice.** `renumber <id> [--to <new>]` moves
the line, the `§<id>` section its pointer resolves to and every dep naming it, in one
transaction — the destination derived in the line's own family unless you name one, spelled the
way `[ids]` says this project spells one, and refused if any source already mentions it. A
**split** is the other direction and not this command: the cited number stays where it is, and
the half that is new is an `add --id <id>b` where `[ids] suffix` declares
one — the one id a caller may choose, `task_id` over MCP, offered only on such a project and
refused without the letter, because a bare number is derived. The ledger is never opened, so the id the other branch
recorded stays theirs; the deps it moved are **named in the answer**, because which of two
collided ids a dep meant is the one thing the files do not say. `ship` and `retire` are wrong
here: both write a terminal entry for work nobody cancelled.

That leaves the two rules a schema cannot check:

`amend <id>` corrects an existing line's `why`, `--dep` group or `--ref` — the fields that are a
fact or a compression — and never its `symptom`, which is the claim the line is, or its `id`,
which is what `renumber` is for. That is the door
a project adopting the tool needs; a greenfield one rarely calls it. Which is also where a
roadmap line **wraps**: `add` refuses to write one, so the count `--lines <n>` asks for is a
thing only an imported backlog carries — and `amend` and `restate` both refuse without it
there, for the reason `record amend` does, a rewritten line otherwise leaving the note under
it stranded beneath a sentence that no longer says what it answered.

A **merge conflict inside a governed file** is not a hand edit either. `merge --register`
wires `roadkeep merge` in as git's driver for the files `roadkeep.toml` declares, and it
merges by id: two branches appending under one heading is two additions, not a conflict, and
an id **both branches created** is reported by name for `renumber` to move. What it cannot
prove — prose changed on both sides, a line that does not round-trip, an output `lint` would
refuse — it hands back as git's own conflict markers and exits 1. `install` names it in its
report and `install --register-merge` runs that half during adoption, so a wired project is
never one whose first parallel branch conflicts by hand. Wiring is two writes — a committed
`.gitattributes` line per file, and a per-clone `git config` path that can stop resolving —
so `merge --check` reads both back and exits 1 unless git would run this driver — the one
query on that command, and the one tool on this surface named for a flag rather than a verb.
Neither half is otherwise visible until the merge it was registered for, so ask once per clone.

1. **`symptom` states what does not work** — never a solution name: a line named after its fix
   cannot be falsified, so it never gets closed, only abandoned.
2. **`why` is one sentence.** A second sentence is the signal the content belongs in the
   rationale file, which is what the pointer addresses.

Markers are `[markers]` in `roadkeep.toml`: the open set is the roadmap's, and the shipped and
retired ones are the ledger's alone — neither is legal in a roadmap. Limits are `[limits]`:
`roadkeep lint` names the file, line and column of anything over, and `--fix` repairs only
what is **derived** (annotation, pointer, dep order, marker codepoint, whitespace). On a
project that arrived with drift, an absolute count answers nothing: `--baseline <rev>`
(`HEAD` after a write) reports **what you added** and forgives the standing debt by name.

## Ask, don't count

Every query takes `--json`. **`budget` is the pre-`add` read that saves a retry**: what a
line leaves its prose fields, derived from the id, the marker, the deps and the pointer — all of which are known before the first word exists. It answers in **both units**: the
characters are what refuses, and the word aim beside them is the one a sentence can be
composed towards, so write to the words and let the gate stay unreached. `budget --block <x> --dep <id>
[--symptom "…"]` is the line an `add` is about to write, and `budget <id>` the one an `amend`
is about to rewrite; the field's own `maxLength` is the ceiling, and what comes back is the
lower number that actually binds. Where `ref_scheme = "outline"` the pointer is structure the
caller chooses, so **pass the same `--ref` you will pass `add`** — unnamed, the answer assumes
the widest anchor on file and says so, which is never more room than the `add` will allow.
**It answers for the whole transaction, not the line alone**: `add --section` writes a body
too, so every `budget` carries a `section` row — the role's word limit, what that anchor
already spends, and an aim that sits **under** the limit, because composing to exactly the
declared number is what refuses. `budget --anchor <a>` asks the same thing on its own, which
is the read a `section amend` wants. **If a body is refused anyway, do not count by hand**:
`body.too-long` names what each paragraph costs and which is the longest, so the second draft
is composed once — and a `0` there is a table or a fence, which is prose no cut can reach. `budget --non-goal [--lead "…"]` is the roadmap's other
bullet, whose two limits are the list's own and not the task line's. Every verb that prints a
section's size states **two** figures where they differ — `48 words, 310 with subsections
(limit 300)` — because the argument is what an `amend` can shorten and the subtree is what a
reader pays; cutting to the second number cuts prose that was never over. Under an outline,
`anchors` names both free addresses before you choose one: `next §<family>.<n>` for a child
and, above the rows, the next free **top-level** — which is what a block reused after its
family shipped needs, and what the listing could not be read for. It reads **every** prose
file the project declares, because one outline spans both and a free address taken from one
of them is one the sibling already spent; `--role` narrows the listing and never that number,
and any address two files both declare is named as `doubled` before you pick one. `brief` prints the `why`'s share of the line it hands over,
so a task started through it never has to ask. **`weight [--block <x>]` is the other pre-`add` read**: what
comparable tasks cost, derived from the commits that shipped them, so whether the line being
written is one task or two is a question with an answer. An entry whose commit wrote several
is named under `batched` and left out of the percentiles, so a squashed adoption import
skews nothing. What comes back is the distribution and what was elided from it, the sample
those percentiles summarise being `--records` and 95% of the payload. It ranks nothing and
lands on no line — the size field is a non-goal. **`roadkeep brief [<id>]` starts a task in one call** — the line,
its rationale, deps resolved, the blocker chain, what it unblocks and the non-goals, bounded
to a tool result; with no id, `pick`'s own choice. Narrower: `next-id` never fills a gap;
`list|stats|audit [--block <x>]` counts and lists, naming every marker line neither could
read; `claims` is the registry read against the files — held, expired or stale, oldest first, where
each id went and where the registry lives, and `--prune` drops the rows that are not claims;
`writes` is the same read for the other sidecar — which governed files a verb wrote and which
nothing did, moving no baseline where the `Stop` hook states it once and consumes it; `show <id>` joins one line, its section and its paths, and on a ledger entry whose bullet
**wraps** it prints every line that entry owns — which is the count `record amend --lines`
asks you to have read; `deps <id>` walks the graph both
ways; `gaps` resolves an id in neither file against the commit that removed it; `origin <id>
--why` reads it out of history, and `origin §<anchor>` answers the other end of a pointer —
a rationale address somebody's prose still cites after a ship deleted the section, which no
file records, so the three answers are the commit that wrote it, the one that took it, and
"searched and nobody ever wrote it", which is what a typo looks like. `anchors [--family <x>]`
is that question about the **addresses**: which a heading declares now, which a ship retired
while every entry citing them stayed, and the next child nothing ever used — the read to make
before reopening a shipped family, since an outline anchor is spent once a heading used it and
`section add` refuses the reuse by name. **You know the block, not the numeral**: a prose file
under an outline declares no block heading, so `anchors --block <x>` is the way in — it names
the family that block's pointers already use and narrows to it, or names both where the block
spans two and leaves the choice with you. And **never restate a count in prose**: `export
[--readme|--site|--json]` projects it.

## Picking work

`roadkeep brief [--block <x>]` picks and briefs in one call, printing why: in-progress first,
then `priority` in `roadkeep.toml`, then the lowest ready id, never one blocked outside.
**Scope it to finish a block**: only "nothing is open in Block <x>" means finished — unscoped,
the answer may be another block's, and the block order is the headings' own (`list`).
**Ready is not implementable**: the tiers rank by id, so add `--designed` when you asked to
*execute* and not to plan — it sets aside the markers `[markers] undesigned` names, and says
how many. Without it the answer still tells you, in the same sentence that names the tier,
that the line it chose has its design to write — which is a `section add`, not a commit.
**Two workers in one checkout need `--claim`**, on `brief` as well as on `pick`: every tier is
a function of the file, so a second caller reading an unchanged backlog is handed the line the
first one took — most confidently by the in-progress tier, a 🛠 line being evidence somebody
started. `--claim` answers *and* moves the marker to in-progress in one transaction, so the
next caller is sent elsewhere. `brief --claim` is the one to reach for, being the call that
starts a task anyway — and over MCP it is its own tool, `claim`, so that `brief` and `pick`
keep the read-only hint that makes asking free; `brief <id> --claim` takes a line you were
told to work on, and is **refused** where somebody already holds that one, there being nothing
for it to choose instead. **The claim follows the marker**, so `status <id>` on the in-progress
one is the third way to start work and takes one too — refused the same way where somebody
already holds that line — while any other marker drops it and is never refused, that being how
a claim is given back. Nothing re-dates a live claim: it is an expiry and not a lock, stepped
over once `[claims] held` has passed, and `ship`, `defer` and `renumber` each do the right
thing with one. A
held line is **named** in the answer and never hidden, because a claim carries no owner and
the id is the only thing you can recognise your own by; who took it belongs in the commit.

## One task, one commit

What `ship` wrote goes in the *same* commit as the code, so the docs never describe a state
that did not ship — and a batch of ready tasks is not permission to batch the commits.

Which is decidable only if the commit knows what is **its**. A claim carries a scope:
`claim <id> --path <p> …` says what this commit owns, declared verbatim and replacing
whatever was there, and `claim <id>` reads it back beside what the working tree holds that
another live claim says is *its* own, what no claim names at all, and which declared path
would stage nothing right now — the analysis
`git add -A` cannot make and a second session's work is what it sweeps up. `--add-path <p>`
is the same write from the other end, for the file the work turned up after the scope was
declared; passing both is refused. Over MCP this verb is the tool `scope` — not `claim`,
which is `brief --claim` and takes a line; the two words are two acts. `--porcelain`
prints the paths alone, for `git add --`. Refused on a line no live claim holds: taking a
line is a marker, and nothing here dates one. **`ship` and `retire` make that read
themselves**, while the claim is still live: what the tree holds that no claim names is
named in the departure's own answer, so the analysis arrives at the moment of committing
rather than being remembered there — **and so is the `git add --` line for the scope being
released**, which after the ship no verb can answer: the claim is gone and the id is in the
ledger. Silent where no claim declared a path.
