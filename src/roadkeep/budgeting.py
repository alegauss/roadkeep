"""What a line has left for prose, asked before a word of it exists (RK190).

RK183 made the `why`'s limit the smaller of its own and what the line has left, and RK184
made the refusal state the surplus. Both act at the same moment: **after** a sentence has
been composed. The number they report is derived from the id, the marker, the deps and the
pointer — every one of which `add` knows before the prose exists — so nothing about it had
to wait for a draft.

That is the arrangement L1 exists to end, one layer in. A `maxLength` refuses before a
sentence is written to fill it; a derived budget delivered only as a refusal has the shape
of a linter again, and the author pays a retry to learn a number the tool could have handed
them. The saving is the analysis: "how long may this sentence be, under these deps" has an
answer, and asking it costs no context (L5).

Two moments and one door. Asked with no id, the budget is the line `add` is *about* to
write — the next id, this project's first marker, the deps the caller names. Asked with an
id, it is the line already on the desk, which an `amend` is about to rewrite; the symptom is
that line's own, so what comes back is the room the `why` really has.

Nothing here restates a limit. Every number is :meth:`Schema.prose_budget`,
:meth:`Schema.why_budget` or a field's own declared maximum, read off the schema — a
constant here would be one more thing to keep true, and the first slot to move would make
this the second opinion an author trusts.

**Validated in characters, published in words** (RK185). A model has no characters: the
tokenizer exposes tokens, so "200 characters" is a target reached by trial and every retry
is a re-guess. Words survive tokenization well enough to be aimed at, so every number above
is also stated as one — the aim, beside the gate. They are not in conflict, because the
character figure is what refuses and the word figure is what an author can act on before a
sentence exists; publishing only the first is the arrangement L1 exists to end. The
conversion itself lives in :mod:`roadkeep.schema` and is read from here (RK201), because
the refusal an author reaches *after* an overrun states its surplus in words off the same
constant — one arithmetic in two directions, and not two constants that can disagree.
